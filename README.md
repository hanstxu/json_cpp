# simple_json_cpp

A lightweight JSON library for C++.

### Additional Stuff to Implement

* Implement the *remove* family of function for JSONObject
* Parsing and converting a JSON stream into the 2 JSON classes
* Deciding what to do on adding multiple values to the same key in JSON objects
* Implementing fractions and exponents in the number data type
* Implementing the [] operator with operator overloading (seems really hard to
do and might have to look into C++11)
