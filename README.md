# simple_json_cpp

A lightweight JSON library for C++.

### Notes

* Currently, all decimals are printed with a precision of 6 decimal places.

### Additional Stuff to Implement

* Implement the *get* and *remove* family of functions for JSONArray
* Implementing some of the functions to look like to_string (i.e. function
  overloading with different parameters)
* Deciding what to do on adding multiple values to the same key in JSON objects
* Implementing exponents in the number data type
* Implementing the [] operator with operator overloading (seems really hard to
do and might have to look into C++11)
